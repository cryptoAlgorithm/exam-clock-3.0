# Exam Clock 3.0

> An exam clock to be used in exams

## About

This is an exam clock made in React. It's main aim is to be used
in an exam to replace one of the other exam clocks, offering more 
features, and a more streamlined user interface.

This clock was inspired by several other exam clocks, like 
[this](https://github.com/appventure-nush/exam-clock-2020) one.

Works best in Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.

### Known issues

* ~~Incorrect clock sizing in browsers without `aspect-ratio` 
  support~~ (FIXED)
  
### Credits 

* The [React](https://reactjs.org/) project 
* The [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) React UI library
